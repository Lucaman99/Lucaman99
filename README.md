### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jack, an incoming undergrad at the University of Toronto. I spend most of my time trying to learn about interesting concepts in pure math and phyics, and my main coding-related interests revolve around making software that helps us better understand physical and mathematical systems.
