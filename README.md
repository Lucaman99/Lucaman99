### Hi there 👋

I'm Jack, here's some info about me:

- I'm going into my second year at the University of Toronto, studying pure mathematics
- I'm currently working at Xanadu, a quantum computing company in Toronto, researching quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry.
- My current interests are: quantum information, topology, quantum mechanics, [fun classical mechanics](https://scholar.harvard.edu/david-morin/classical-mechanics), and more
- I code in Python and write a lot of TeX, usually in Spacemacs/Vim (or at least a code editor with Vim keybindings)

I'm always on the look-out for interesting conversations and projects. Contact me at: jackceroni [at] gmail [dot] com. For more info on me and my current projects, check out [my website](https://lucaman99.github.io/).
