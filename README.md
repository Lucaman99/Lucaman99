### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jack, here's some info about me:

- I've completed two years of undergrad at the University of Toronto, studying pure mathematics
- I'm currently taking a gap semester to work at a startup
- Prior to this, I worked at Xanadu for 2 years, a quantum computing company in Toronto, researching quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry.
- My current interests are: quantum and classical information theory, machine learning, statistical mechanics, quantum chemistry, [complexity](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PRjgI8kAAAAJ&hl=en), topology, [fun classical mechanics](https://scholar.harvard.edu/david-morin/classical-mechanics), and more
- I code in Python and write a lot of TeX, usually in Spacemacs/Vim (or at least a code editor with Vim keybindings)

I'm always on the look-out for interesting conversations and projects. Contact me at: jackceroni [at] gmail [dot] com. For more info on me and my current projects, check out [my website](https://lucaman99.github.io/).
