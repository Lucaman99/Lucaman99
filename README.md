### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jack, here's some info about me:

- I'm a third-year undergrad at the University of Toronto, studying pure mathematics
- Prior to this, I spent some time at MIT researching quantum algorithms, I was the first employee at a stealth quantum/AI startup (I took a gap year from 2022-2023 to do this), I worked at Xanadu for 2 years: a quantum computing company in Toronto, researching quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry.
- My current interests lie at the intersection of quantum algorithms/simulation and mathematics. I also like to think about [complexity](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PRjgI8kAAAAJ&hl=en).
- I'm a fan of [fun classical mechanics](https://scholar.harvard.edu/david-morin/classical-mechanics) (RIP Brilliant.org, you were my first love)
- I code in Python and write a lot of TeX, usually in Spacemacs/Vim (or at least a code editor with Vim keybindings)

I'm always on the look-out for interesting conversations and projects. Contact me at: jackceroni [at] gmail [dot] com. For more info on me and my current projects, check out [my website](https://lucaman99.github.io/).
