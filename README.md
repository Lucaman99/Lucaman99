### Hi there

I'm Jack, here's some info about me:

- I'm a third-year undergrad at the University of Toronto, studying pure mathematics
- Prior to this, I spent some time at MIT researching quantum algorithms, I was the research scientist at a stealth quantum/AI startup (I took a gap year from 2022-2023 to do this), I worked at Xanadu for 2 years: a quantum computing company in Toronto, researching quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry.
- My current interests lie at the intersection of quantum algorithms/simulation and pure mathematics. I also like to think about [complexity](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PRjgI8kAAAAJ&hl=en).
